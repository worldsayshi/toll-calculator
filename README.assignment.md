# Toll fee calculator 1.0

A calculator for vehicle toll fees.

- Make sure you read these instructions carefully
- The current code base is in Java and C#, but please make sure that you do an implementation in a language **you feel comfortable** in like Javascript, Python, Assembler or [ModiScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModiScript) (please don't choose ModiScript).

## Background

Our city has decided to implement toll fees in order to reduce traffic congestion during rush hours.
This is the current draft of requirements:

- Fees will differ between 8 SEK and 18 SEK, depending on the time of day
- Rush-hour traffic will render the highest fee
- The maximum fee for one day is 60 SEK
- A vehicle should only be charged once an hour
  - In the case of multiple fees in the same hour period, the highest one applies.
- Some vehicle types are fee-free
- Weekends and holidays are fee-free

## Your assignment

The previous developer quit recently, claiming that this solution is production-ready.
You are now the new developer for our city - congratulations!

Your job is to deliver the code and from now on you are the responsible go-to-person for this solution. This is a solution you will have to put your name on.

## Instructions

You can make any modifications or suggestions for what you see fit. Fork this repository and deliver your results via a pull-request or send us an e-mail. You could also create a gist, for privacy reasons, and send us the link.

### ❗️ Important notes

- Emphasis on _This is a solution you will have to put your name on_. Is your solution something that you would be confident running in production?
- **You don't have to write a fully fledged solution**. However, do write comments explaining your intention and what you would have done if you had the time.

## Help I dont know C# or Java

No worries! We accept submissions in other languages as well.
